                    The Founding of Sheridan Swiftie Club!
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    It all started in late October 2023 with a simple idea and a
                    lot of passion. Alongside two fellow Swifties, we decided to
                    create a space where fans of Taylor Swift's music could come
                    together and share their love for her songs. Our journey
                    began at the Coffee Loft, where the three of us met to
                    discuss our vision for the club. Despite starting with just
                    four members, our dedication and enthusiasm quickly
                    attracted more Swifties.

                    Facilitating New Student Orientation at Sheridan College
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    One of the most rewarding experiences I've had at Sheridan
                    College was facilitating the New Student Orientation. As a
                    Peer Mentor, I had the privilege of welcoming new students
                    to our vibrant community and helping them navigate the start
                    of their college journey.
