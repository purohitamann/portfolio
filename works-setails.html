                      Our journey began at the Coffee Loft, where the three of
                      us met to discuss our vision for the club. Despite
                      starting with just four members, our dedication and
                      enthusiasm quickly attracted more Swifties. We organized
                      movie nights, listening parties, and engaging events that
                      brought our community closer together.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As the president of the club, I am incredibly proud of how
                      far we've come in such a short time. From the indie folk
                      vibes of "folklore" to the emotional depth of "All Too
                      Well" (the 10-minute version), our club celebrates every
                      aspect of Taylor Swift's music. With many more events and
                      exciting plans ahead, I can‚Äôt wait to create more memories
                      and jam out to Taylor's tunes with all of you! üåàüé§ Oh,
                      and here‚Äôs a little teaser for our next event üé•üçø Hint:
                      It involves snakes, drama, and a lot of üî•. Can you guess
                      what it is? Stay tuned for more details!

                      Facilitating New Student Orientation at Sheridan College
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      One of the most rewarding experiences I've had at Sheridan
                      College was facilitating the New Student Orientation. As a
                      Peer Mentor, I had the privilege of welcoming new students
                      to our vibrant community and helping them navigate the
                      start of their college journey.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The orientation was a mix of excitement and nervousness
                        for many incoming students, and my goal was to make them
                        feel comfortable and supported. We kicked off the event
                        with a warm welcome, followed by informative sessions on
                        academic resources, campus facilities, and
                        extracurricular opportunities. I led campus tours,
                        highlighting key spots and sharing tips on how to make
                        the most out of their college experience.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        One of the highlights was the icebreaker activities,
                        where students got to know each other and started
                        forming friendships. It was heartwarming to see shy
                        faces light up as they connected with their peers. I
                        also facilitated group discussions and Q&A sessions,
                        providing answers and insights to help ease any
                        anxieties they had about starting college.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Helping new students feel at home and confident in their
                        new environment was incredibly fulfilling. Knowing that
                        I played a part in their successful transition to
                        college life is something I‚Äôll always cherish. I‚Äôm
                        excited to see these students thrive and make the most
                        of their time at Sheridan College!
